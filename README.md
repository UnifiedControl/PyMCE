PyMCE
=====
*Python MCE IR Library (EventGhost MceRemote_Vista plugin modified to work standalone) (Windows Only)*

**NOTE:**
This library does not contain an IR Decoder, only Raw IR Code Receiving and Pronto Code Receive + Transmit are supported.

**Credit goes to EventGhost / Lars-Peter Voss for doing all the hard work!**
